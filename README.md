This app was made using React.js. Once you open the app, first decide on which image you would like for your poster. If you don't like the first one that appear, you can select the "Get new poster image" button until you find one that you like. Then, you can use the text boxes to apply whatever text you would like to the poster. The poster text will update in real time as you type!
